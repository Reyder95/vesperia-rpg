# Vesperia RPG
**Note: Name is subject to change**

## What is Vesperia RPG?
A throwback to old school turn-based JRPGs. FINAL FANTASY is a big inspiration, and I really enjoyed FINAL FANTASY III. This game will take the turn-based combat and random encounters from FINAL FANTASY, mixed with some common loot-based tropes used in modern-day games, to craft an experience that will cater to both old school and new age players.

The game will have an immersive story that will take a good amount of time to complete. A world where the player can connect to the characters, and a world where there is a lot to do. I'd like the game story to stretch a good bit without dragging it on for so long.

## Dungeons? Loot? 
There will be a lot of Dungeons in the game, each with their own unique monsters and bosses, along with unique loot. Incredible armor and weapon await you if you have what it takes.

## Builds?

### What is a build?
A set of items, gear, and spells that a player can put together to break the limits of what is thought to be possible. This is the type of thoughts I'd like to promote.

### Examples?
- A fire-focused build that propells a spell Fireball beyond its limits. Turns the spell into AoE that can set enemies on fire dealing massive damage.
- Speed builds that allow a character to attack more than once a turn.

Builds could be based on the entire team.
